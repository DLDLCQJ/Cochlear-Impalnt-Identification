# Cochlear-Impalnt-Identification
Neural Prediction of Spoken Language Improvements in Children with Cochlear Implants

# Objective 
This study aims to construct neural predictive models to forecast post-cochlear implant (CI) language improvements in local hearing-impaired children and to evaluate whether these models are language-specific or language-universal based on CI candidates learning English.

# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
## 1.Transfer Learning Models
The standard transfer learning strategy involves using pre-trained CNN models on ImageNet as the backbone of the model, followed by fine-tuning the top layers. 

Such as: AlexNet, VGG19, ResNet, Inception, GoogleNet, MobileNet, and DenseNet.

## 2. Machine Learning Models
Linear regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
