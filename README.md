# Cochlear-Impalnt-Identification
Neural Prediction of Spoken Language Outcomes in Children with Cochlear Implants: A Multi-Center Study

# Objective 
This study aims to construct neural predictive models to forecast post-cochlear implant (CI) language outcomes in local hearing-impaired children and to evaluate whether these models are language-specific or language-universal based on CI candidates learning English.
